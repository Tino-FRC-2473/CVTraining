This means that for all points (x,y) inside the circle, $x^2 + y^2 < 1$. If we construct a fine grid of points in a square around the circle and count the number of points inside the circle, we can make an estimate of the area of the circle as a fraction of the area of the bounding square. Then via $Area = \\pi r^2$, we have an approximation of π. This is a simple version of the Monte Carlo method of random sampling, which is often used to estimate solutions to difficult problems."
